	     Welcome to OpenSCADA, an open SCADA system.

You can find the documentation for the program in the Project Knowledge Base online at http://oscada.org/wiki and install offline
with the package "openscada-doc-{lng}", which usually contains:
  Release_*.pdf - announce of the program version.
  Terms.html - terms, definitions and abbreviations.
  FAQ.html - frequently asked questions about the program.
  About.html - information about the program as a whole.
  Functions_and_demands.html - functions and demands of OpenSCADA.
  Program_manual.html - program manual.
  User_API.html - user API of OpenSCADA
  DAQ.html - concept of the data acquisition of OpenSCADA.
  Quick_start.html - quick start of OpenSCADA.
  Modules/* - directory with the modules documentation.

To launch OpenSCADA, simply type the command <openscada> and start the program with the OpenSCADA project selection dialog.
Configuration of the standard and the new project is sufficient for:
 - working into the graphical configurator UI.QTCfg;
 - working into the WEB-configurators (adress: http://localhost:10002 or http://localhost:10004)

To start in the daemon mode (server), there is a project "server" in the openscada-server package that can be started by
the <service openscada-server start> command.

To facilitate the first experience with the program, a demonstration package (openscada-model-aglks) was created.
This package contains a database with examples of configuration of the program and all its subsystems.
To run the demo configuration, simply type the command <openscada_AGLKS>.

In the process, you may need passwords to log in to the program. Standard and new projects contain the following users:
 - root: system administrator, have password: "openscada";
 - user: unprivileged user, have password: "user".

If you have any questions, please contact the site http://oscada.org for more information.
