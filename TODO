To do tasks of the project OpenSCADA

1. System's testing/optimization
  * Make optimal operations to value buffer, more for buffer reading into mode soft time grid (slower of writing to 40 times).
  * Develope new mechanism of testing and it connection (based on present modules Special/SystemTests).
    Creation configuration and control dialog (by help of control interface of system).
  * Make checking of system code by help of program and other programs.

2. System

3. Modules

4. Subsystem DB
  * Make DB module for ODBC support.
  * Make DB module for DBMS PostgresSQL support.
  * Make DB module for OpenLDAP support.
  * Make DB module for DBMS Oracle support.

5. Subsystem “Data acquisition” (DAQ)
  * Add functions of API of the user programming for management of controllers;
  * Creation of the interface of the status of controllers of subsystem DAQ for the control over status of a source of data and statistics of data acquisition.
  * Data acquisition module realisation for data transfer through DB tables of free structure.
  * Data acquisition module realisation for data transfer through file of free structure.
  * Make data acquisition module for gathering data from OPC-servers (for it should use OPC-server through Ethernet, based on drive Unidrive SP1202).

5.1. Logic level parameters
  * Make full parameters standby (include archives) on logical level parameters.

5.2. System
  * Data source support is added: file system stat (busy, free of disk area).

5.3. JavaLikeCalc
  * Add massif support.

6. Subsystem “Transports”
  * Make realisation of SNMP protocol's agent.
  * Transport “Serial” realisation.

7. Subsystem “Protocols of transports”
  * Make access protocol to OpenSCADA through ModBUS/TCP and ModBUS/RTU.

8. Subsystem “User interfaces”

8.1. VCAEngine
  * Add functions of API of the user programming for management of a session (VCA).
  * Develope and making the “Function” primitive.
  * Develope and making the “Link” primitive.
  * Styles and the themes manager realisation.

8.2. Vision
  * Develope and making the “Function” primitive.
  * Develope and making the “Link” primitive.

8.3. WebVision
  * Develope and making the “Function” primitive.
  * Develope and making the “Link” primitive.

9. Subsystem “Archives”
  * Make module for export to mail and SMS.

10. Subsystem “Security”

11. Subsystem “Special”

12. Documentation
  * Make actual and detailed describe the conception of logical level parameters (RU).
    Include this document into list of main documentation of OpenSCADA.
    Include to this document chapter for methods of data gathering and comparative its analysis (simple synchronous, simple asynchronous, packet and passive).
  * Describe deeply mechanisms of calculation, links, events process and the engine of visual area working.
  * Make manual for quick starting.
  * Translate the documentations to English and Ukrainian languages:
    * API of system;
    * Modules documentation.

13. Project site
  * Add changes tracker and continued works at project tracker.
