To do tasks of the project OpenSCADA

1. Questions for study
  * Study multitier -> CORBA. 
  * Study http://www.opennet.ru/opennews/art.shtml?num=2475. 
  * Study EiffelStudio: http://www.eiffel.com/products/studio52. 
  * Study http://www.wl.unn.ru/~ragozin/compiler/compil/g2.htm.

2. System's testing/optimization
  * Make optimal operations to value buffer, more for buffer reading into mode soft time grid (slower of writing to 40 times). 
  * Develope new mechanism of testing and it connection (based on present modules Special/SystemTests). Creation configuration and control dialog (by help of control interface of system). 
  * Make checking of system code by help of program and other programs.

3. System

4. Modules
